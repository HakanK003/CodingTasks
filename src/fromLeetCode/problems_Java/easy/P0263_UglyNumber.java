    -> https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number/

        An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
        Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

    Examples
    -> Example 1
            Input: n = 6
            Output: true
            Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3
    -> Example 2
            Input: n = 1
            Output: true
            Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
    -> Example 3
            Input: n = 14
            Output: false
            Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.

    Constraints
    -> -2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1

/**
 * Approach 1 -> Math
 *
 *   Divide number to 2, 3, 5 until it's 1 or can't dividable more. After divisions if n==1 return true otherwise false.
 *   If number is negative directly false because, numbers that has only 2, 3, 5 as prime factor can't be negative.
 *
 * Time Complexity -> O(log(n))
 *   We can divide max log(n) times
 *
 * Space Complexity -> O(1)
 *
 * Result
 *   Runtime: 2 ms, faster than 80.60% of Java online submissions for Ugly Number.
 *   Memory Usage: 41.1 MB, less than 60.08% of Java online submissions for Ugly Number.
